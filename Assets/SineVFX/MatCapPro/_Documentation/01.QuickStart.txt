IMPORTANT NOTES:

- If you using LWRP or URP make sure, you enable HDR, Depth and Opaque textures in LWRP/URP Asset settings
- Turn on "HDR" on your Camera, Shaders requires it
- This VFX Asset looks much better in "Linear Rendering", but if you using "Gamma Rendering" Mode, you need to slightly decrease the Final Power material parameter of each effect.
- Image Effects are necessary in order to make a great looking game, as well as our asset. Be sure you use "Tone Mapping" and "Bloom"
- Your camera must render Depth texture in order for some effects to appear correctly



HOW THIS EFFECT WORK:

- These effects consist of two materials. One creating a grayscale MatCap texture (you can colorize it if you want). The second material layer used for
colorization and adding the Edge Detection effect.
- You can use only one material with the "FirstLayer" prefix. In this case, you need to enable "Single Layer Coloring Enabled" inside Material settings. After that
you can pick Gradient Texture, and also enable the Wireframe effect.
- The method above is needed if you want to apply MatCapPro effects to a mesh with multiple submeshes (multiple material slots on a single mesh), like complex humanoid characters. You can also just split
these submeshes in any 3d program and reimport your fbx/obj mesh.
- We recommend using two layers for stylized meshes with normal maps, but for low-poly style you can plug just one FirstLayer material.



HOW TO USE:

- First of all, check for Demo Scene in the Scenes folder. Also, there is a Prefabs folder with complete effects.
- There are prefabs of example meshes in a "Prefabs" folder. You can pick what you like and copy its FirstLayer and SecondLayer materials.
- After that, just apply these materials to your GameObject.
- Some Meshes using RampGeneratorV2.cs script. This script generates the gradient texture and applies it to the material. It only works in play mode, so
in the editor window the result will be different.



BASIC ADJUSTMENTS AND CUSTOMIZATION:

- In the FirstLayer material, the main adjustments come from selecting MatCap and Ramp textures. You also can rotate and scale the main MatCap.
- In the SecondLayer material, you can customize the EdgeDetection effect, and colorize the whole mesh. Both layers have the Final Opacity parameter to make them transparent.
- Materials have a lot of settings, just play with them, and create your own unique look. Be aware, that in a play mode, some materials will be converted into instances because their values are changing by the Animator component. So if you change material settings in a play mode, the original material won't be affected. This is a great way to just test all the settings.
- Most of the parameters are described in a "02.MaterialParameters.txt" file.
