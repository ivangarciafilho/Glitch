If your mesh has multiple submeshes (multiple material slots, very common on game characters), you need to split them in any 3d software or use only one FirstLayer material.

1. There are two packages for HDRP and URP, plus one for Standard Renderer. Choose the correct one, based on what SRP you using and unpack it.

2. For URP, it is recommended to enable these settings inside Pipeline Asset: Opaque Texture, Depth Texture, HDR. Also, enable PostProcessing in your Camera.

3. For HDRP, you don't need to enable additional settings, just unpack and check the DemoScene.

4. For better visual results use Linear Rendering instead of Gamma. You can choose it in a "Project Settings/Player" menu

5. Check "_Documentation" folder
