////////// FIRST LAYER MATERIAL PARAMETERS:

Final Power - Final brightness of the image, you need to lower this value if you using "Gamma Rendering" Mode
Final Opacity - Adjust the opacity of the effect
Final Opacity Dither Enabled - Generates a noise-like texture for smooth blending
*** Final parameters are mostly used to adjust the result look of the effect, its emission power, and opacity

MatCap Texture - MatCap Mask texture, used for coloring
MatCap Normal - Normal texture of the mesh
MatCap Scale - Adjust the scale of MatCap, keep it at 0.95 for better results
MatCap Rotation- Rotates the MatCap Texture to change lighting direction

Single Layer Coloring Enabled - Enables the single layer workflow, when using this, you don't need a second layer of the effect
Ramp - Gradient Texture, can be generated with RampGeneratorV2.cs script
Ramp Color Tint - Multiplying the texture by Color
Ramp Tiling Exp - Adjust the tiling/scale of the Ramp Texture
Mask Glow Exp - Control the emission mask, higher values mean that only the bright spots will glow
Mask Glow Amount - Glow power
Wireframe Enabled - Enables the wireframe effect
Wireframe Power - Emission power of the effect
Wireframe Thickness - Thickness of the lines
Wireframe Fresnel Exp - Control the Rim Mask for the wireframe effect
Wireframe Glow Amount - Emission power of the effect
Opacity Texture - Texture, used for opacity mask, check the tree leaves for example
Opacity Texture Channel - What channel is used for opacity masking, XYZW == RGBA

////////// SECOND LAYER MATERIAL PARAMETERS:

Final Power - Final brightness of the image, you need to lower this value if you using "Gamma Rendering" Mode
Final Opacity - Adjust the opacity of the effect
Final Opacity Dither Enabled - Generates a noise-like texture for smooth blending
*** Final parameters are mostly used to adjust the result look of the effect, its emission power, and opacity

Edges Only Mode Enabled - The second layer produces only the edge detection effect, in this case you can use it even as a post effect

Ramp - Gradient Texture, can be generated with RampGeneratorV2.cs script
Ramp Color Tint - Multiplying the texture by Color
Edge Detection Thickness - Thickness of the lines
Mask Glow Exp - Control the emission mask, higher values mean that only the bright spots will glow
Mask Glow Amount - Glow power
Edge Detection Exp - Adjust the look of the edges, higher values for more clear looking edges
Edge Glow Amount - Emission power of the edge detection effect
Edge Mask Power - Control the mask power of the edge detection effect
Edge Fresnel Exp - Control the Rim Mask for the edge detection effect
Wireframe Enabled - Enables the wireframe effect
Wireframe Power - Emission power of the effect
Wireframe Thickness - Thickness of the lines
Wireframe Fresnel Exp - Control the Rim Mask for the wireframe effect
Wireframe Glow Amount - Emission power of the effect
Opacity Texture - Texture, used for opacity mask, check the tree leaves for example
Opacity Texture Channel - What channel is used for opacity masking, XYZW == RGBA
